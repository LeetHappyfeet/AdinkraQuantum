# AdinkraQuantum

AdinkraQuantum is a Python project that explores the application of quantum computing concepts to adinkra structures, aiming to uncover hidden dualities and metric shifts within the adinkra framework.

## Overview

Adinkras are graphical representations used in theoretical physics to study supersymmetry. These structures encode information about the symmetries and properties of supersymmetric theories. Adinkras consist of points connected by lines, with each point representing a supersymmetric multiplet.

In this project, we leverage quantum computing techniques to perform transformations on adinkra points, simulating the effects of Clifford Conjugation operations and Riemannian Metric Shift transformations. By applying Pauli-X, Pauli-Y, and Pauli-Z gates to adinkra points, we can induce complex conjugation-like changes, alter distances between points, and influence spatial relationships, potentially revealing deeper insights into the underlying symmetries and structures.

## Installation

To run AdinkraQuantum, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need the following dependencies:
